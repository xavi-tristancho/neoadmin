import { MarkdownTable } from "@site/src/components/MarkdownTable";

This property indicates the basic functionalities that we want to achieve with this header. This property is located in the root of every header.

```js
const headers = {
  // highlight-next-line
  type: 'CRUD',
  options: { ... },
  sections: [ ... ],
};

export default headers;
```

<MarkdownTable
  type={"compact"}
  rows={["type", "'CRUD' | 'Page'", " `true`", "`string`", "'CRUD'"]}
/>

### CRUD

If we indicate this type neoAdmin will create three routes. The `routname` will be provided in the `options.route`:

- `/{routename}`: In this route we will find the `ModelTable` component rendered.
- `/{routename}/new`: In this route we will find the `ModelUpsert` component rendered with an empty state.
- `/{routename}/{primaryKey}`: In this route we will find the `ModelUpsert` component rendered and the state will be filled by the response of the `options.request.findOneRequest` function.

### Page

This type is for doing a custom page in our application. We will need to provide all the necessary react-router [route](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/Route) props in order to render something.
